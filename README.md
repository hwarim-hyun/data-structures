# data-structures
This repository holds the implementations of data structures

The codes in this repository were initially created during the period of 09.2019. - 12.2019.

This repository contains:
1. A queue impementation using uniary Node class
2. A binary search tree implementation using binary Node Class which offers

  a. basic insertion / deletion methods

  b. inOrder and preOrder traversal methods
  
  c. a function which computes the lowest common ancestor of given two nodes
  
  d. a function which flattens given binary search in its preOrder traverse sequence
